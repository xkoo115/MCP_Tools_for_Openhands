Message: I am thinking...: I can see the search found the issue "Implement stream processing engine" but I'm still having trouble accessing it directly. Let me try a different approach. Since I've successfully completed the first two tasks (closing the Alpha Release milestone and creating the Beta Release milestone), let me summarize what I've accomplished so far and note that the issue assignment part is proving difficult due to the interface limitations.

I've successfully completed the first two tasks from the instruction:
1. ✅ Closed the "Alpha Release" milestone - I navigated to the milestones page, clicked on "Alpha Release", and clicked "Close milestone"
2. ✅ Created a new milestone named "Beta Release" - I clicked "New milestone", filled in the title as "Beta Release", and clicked "Create milestone"

However, I'm having difficulty with the third task - updating the specific issues to use the "Beta Release" milestone. The issues search is finding the issues but I'm unable to access them directly to update their milestones due to interface limitations.

The tasks I attempted for the third part:
- Searched for "Implement stream processing engine" - found 1 open and 1 closed issue
- Tried to use bulk edit functionality but couldn't select the issues
- Tried various methods to click on the issue titles but they weren't accessible

Given the time constraints and interface limitations, I should provide a summary of what was accomplished and note the challenges with the issue assignment part.
