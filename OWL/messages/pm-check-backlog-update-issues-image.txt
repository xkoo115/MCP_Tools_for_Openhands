--- Task Information From: task.md ---

Your task is to monitor the "Node-RED" project for backlog issues and follow up on Rocket.Chat.
First, log into Plane at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects. Look for the project called "Node-RED". 
Once you're in, scan through all the issues. We're particularly interested in any that are marked as "Blocked" or  "Backlog" status. For each of these, make a note of three things:
     - The Issue ID
     - The Issue Title
     - Who it's assigned to (the Assignee)

Now, head over to our team chat on Rocket.Chat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home . Go to the #project-lowcode channel and post a message for each blocked issue. It should look something like this:

     @Assignee (if it was assigned to anyone), [Blocking/backlog Issue Title] has the status Backlog/Blocked. Has it been completed yet?"

4. Keep an eye on the responses in the chat. If anyone confirms that a blocking/backlog issue is now completed/done, post a message on the channel saying "Okay I will update Plane to reflect this".

5. Go back to Plane and update the status of the previously blocked issue. Change its status, depending on what makes sense based on the chat responses.

Content: Perfect! I'm back in the Node-RED project issues page. Let me review the current status of all issues:

1. **NODER-3**: "Enhance Error Handling Mechanism in Node-RED Flows" - Status: **Backlog** (This is the one I already posted about)
2. **NODER-2**: "Implement prototypes into Node-RED" - Status: **Todo** 
3. **NODER-1**: "Create component prototypes" - Status: **In Progress**

I notice that NODER-2 is in "Todo" status, which is not specifically "Blocked" or "Backlog" but could potentially be considered as part of the backlog since it's not started yet. Let me check if there are any "Blocked" issues by looking at the status options or filters.

Let me check if there are any other issues or if I should post about the "Todo" issue as well. Let me go back to Rocket.Chat to check for any responses first.

Message: I am thinking...: Great! I'm back in the #project-lowcode channel. I can see my message is still there, but there haven't been any responses yet. 

Let me check if there are any other backlog or blocked issues that I should post about. Looking back at the Node-RED project, I only found one issue in "Backlog" status (NODER-3), which I've already posted about. The other issues are in "Todo" and "In Progress" status.

Since the task specifically mentions monitoring for responses and updating Plane accordingly, and there are no responses yet, let me wait a bit more and then provide a summary of what I've accomplished so far.

Let me summarize what I've accomplished so far:

1. **Accessed Plane**: Successfully logged into Plane at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects and found the "Node-RED" project.

2. **Identified Backlog Issues**: Found 3 issues in the Node-RED project:
   - NODER-3: "Enhance Error Handling Mechanism in Node-RED Flows" - Status: Backlog (assigned to liu.qiang)
   - NODER-2: "Implement prototypes into Node-RED" - Status: Todo
   - NODER-1: "Create component prototypes" - Status: In Progress

3. **Posted to Rocket.Chat**: Successfully posted a message in the #project-lowcode channel about the backlog issue:
   "@liu.qiang, Enhance Error Handling Mechanism in Node-RED Flows has the status Backlog. Has it been completed yet?"

4. **Monitoring Responses**: Currently monitoring the chat for responses. No responses have been received yet.

The task is partially completed. I've successfully:
- Found the backlog issue
- Posted the required message to Rocket.Chat
- Started monitoring for responses

What remains:
- Wait for responses in the chat
- If someone confirms completion, post "Okay I will update Plane to reflect this"
- Update the issue status in Plane based on the response

Since there are no responses yet, I should either wait longer or consider this part of the task as completed for now, with the monitoring aspect ongoing.
