Content: Perfect! Chen Xinyi has responded with the requirements. Now I have all the information I need to evaluate Jane Lee's candidacy. Let me summarize what I've learned:

**Requirements from Chen Xinyi:**
- Must be U.S. citizen or green card holder (due to clearance requirements)
- Bachelor's or Master's in Computer Science or related field
- Strong fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and database systems
- Competitive salary: $220k

**Jane Lee's qualifications from her resume:**
- Education: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University (2020-2024)
- Technical Skills: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Relevant Coursework: Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Database Management Systems
- Internship Experience: Software Engineering Intern at Tech Solutions Inc. and StartUp Co.
- Projects: Smart Shopping Assistant (AI-powered recommendation system), Real-time Chat Application
- Certifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, MongoDB Certified Developer Associate

**Key Issue:** Jane Lee's resume states "Requires visa sponsorship for employment in the United States" which conflicts with the requirement for U.S. citizenship or green card holder status.

Let me report back to Li Ming with my findings:

I have successfully completed the task by:

1. **Contacted Li Ming** - Reached out to the Database Team Project Manager to inquire about the requirements for the new grad software engineer position.

2. **When Li Ming didn't respond, contacted Chen Xinyi** - As instructed in the task, I reached out to the Human Resources Manager when Li Ming was unavailable.

   - Must be U.S. citizen or green card holder (due to clearance requirements)
   - Bachelor's or Master's in Computer Science or related field
   - Strong fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and database systems

5. **Evaluated Jane Lee's qualifications**:
   - **Positive**: Strong technical background from Carnegie Mellon University, relevant coursework, internship experience, projects, and certifications
   - **Critical Issue**: Requires visa sponsorship for employment in the United States

6. **Provided comprehensive assessment to Li Ming** with supporting evidence, clearly explaining why Jane Lee cannot proceed with next steps due to the visa sponsorship requirement conflicting with the clearance requirements.
