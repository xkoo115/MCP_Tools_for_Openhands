--- Task Information From: task.md ---
Our CTO, Sarah Johnson, want to know more on the engineering progress we've been made throughtout the past few months, so she requested a presentation introducing all gitlab repositories we have now. You can access this at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/  You will need to create a slide deck, with an introductory page titled "Overview of Our Engineering Progress". Then for each gitlab repository, create one slide including the repo name, its description, and the number of all issues and merge requests (including open, closed/merged, etc.)
Save the presentation to '/workspace/Engineering_Progress.pptx'. Make sure the repo slides are ordered as displayed on http://the-agent-company.com:8929/

--- Checkpoints Information From: checkpoints.md ---
# Checkpoints
This has total of 5 points. Partial score can be provided for last checkpoint.

## Checkpoint 1 (1 point)
Check if the presentation file '/workspace/Engineering_Progress.pptx' exists

## Checkpoint 2 (4 point)
Check if each repository has a corresponding page, including all four necessary information in it (repo name, description, number of all merge requests and number of all issues)

Message: I am thinking...: Now I can see the GitLab projects. Let me collect the repository information from the page. I can see there are multiple repositories listed. Let me click on each repository to get more detailed information about issues and merge requests.

From the GitLab page, I can see there are 14 repositories listed in this order:
1. api-server
2. bustub
3. colly
4. copilot-arena-server
5. Documentation (doc)
6. janusgraph
7. llama.cpp
8. node-red
9. openhands
10. opensearch
11. raft
12. risingwave
13. sotopia
14. streamlit

For each repository, I need to collect:
- Repository name
- Description
- Number of issues (all statuses)
- Number of merge requests (all statuses)

I can see some counts directly from the main page, but I should click into each repository to get the complete counts including closed/merged items.

Content: Now I can see the GitLab projects. Let me collect the repository information from the page. I can see there are multiple repositories listed. Let me click on each repository to get more detailed information about issues and merge requests.
