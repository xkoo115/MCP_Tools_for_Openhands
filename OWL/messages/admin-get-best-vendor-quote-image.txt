--- Task Information From: task.md ---
We need to order a new server. I think Emma Lewis has collected quotes from a few companies and put them on OwnCloud. Ask her where you can find the quotes. Then download them to the workspace directory. You can discuss with Sarah about the requirements. Please create a csv file "valid-quotes.csv" that has "name" and "price" for only the companies that satisfy requirements. Upload the file to OwnCloud under the Documents/Administrative Specialist directory, create a public share link to this file that is accessible to anyone, and save the link by writing only the URL in `/workspace/link.txt`

You can access rocket chat here: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
You can access OwnCloud here: http://the-agent-company.com:8092
