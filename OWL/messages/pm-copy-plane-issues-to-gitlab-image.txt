Content: Now I'm back on the JanusGraph issues page. Let me analyze the issues to identify all "In Progress" tasks. From what I can see in the accessibility tree, I can identify the status of each issue:

- JANUS-6: "Optimize Retry Mechanism for Out of Memory Errors" - Status: Backlog
- JANUS-5: "Improve Logging for Bulk Request Failures" - Status: Backlog  
- JANUS-4: "Integrate algorithms into existing graph database" - Status: Todo
- JANUS-3: "Research and design new algorithms" - Status: In Progress ✓
- JANUS-2: "Implement optimization techniques for large datasets" - Status: Todo
- JANUS-1: "Analyze current query performance bottlenecks" - Status: Todo

So I can see that there is only ONE "In Progress" issue: JANUS-3 "Research and design new algorithms".

Now let me access the GitLab page to add this issue.

Message: I am thinking...: Great! The issue has been successfully created in GitLab. I can see that the issue "Research and design new algorithms" has been created with issue number #4659. The issue is now in GitLab and assigned to Administrator (root).

Let me verify that this was the only "In Progress" issue in Plane by checking if there are any other "In Progress" issues that need to be added.

Let me review what I've accomplished:

1. I identified the "In Progress" issues in Plane:
   - From the Plane issues page, I found that there was only ONE issue with "In Progress" status: JANUS-3 "Research and design new algorithms"

2. I successfully added this issue to GitLab:
   - Created a new issue in GitLab with the title "Research and design new algorithms"
   - Assigned it to the current user (Administrator/root)
   - The issue was created successfully with issue number #4659

3. Other issues in Plane had different statuses:
   - JANUS-6: "Optimize Retry Mechanism for Out of Memory Errors" - Backlog
   - JANUS-5: "Improve Logging for Bulk Request Failures" - Backlog
   - JANUS-4: "Integrate algorithms into existing graph database" - Todo
   - JANUS-2: "Implement optimization techniques for large datasets" - Todo
   - JANUS-1: "Analyze current query performance bottlenecks" - Todo

The task specifically asked to add all "In Progress" tasks to GitLab, and I have successfully added the only "In Progress" task from Plane to GitLab.

Content: Great! The issue has been successfully created in GitLab. I can see that the issue "Research and design new algorithms" has been created with issue number #4659. The issue is now in GitLab and assigned to Administrator (root).

Let me verify that this was the only "In Progress" issue in Plane by checking if there are any other "In Progress" issues that need to be added.
