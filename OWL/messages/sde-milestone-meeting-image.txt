Message: I am thinking...: Now I have a clear picture of the open and unassigned merge requests for milestone Release v1.1.0. Let me summarize my findings and then access RocketChat to discuss them with the team.

Based on my investigation of the JanusGraph repository, I found the following open and unassigned merge requests with milestone "Release v1.1.0":

1. **Merge Request #4657**: "Bump net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy from 1.14.18 to 1.15.0"
   - Status: Ready to merge! (shows "Ready to merge!" status)
   - Type: Dependency update
   - Assignee: Unassigned
   - This is a simple dependency bump that appears ready to be merged

2. **Merge Request #4456**: "Add batch query support for drop step [tp-tests]"
   - Status: Has merge conflicts and blocked (shows "Merge conflicts must be resolved")
   - Type: Feature implementation
   - Assignee: Unassigned
   - This has technical issues that need to be resolved before merging

Now I need to:
1. Access RocketChat to discuss these merge requests with the team
2. Create a meeting agenda
3. Merge the ready merge request (#4657)
4. Discuss how to resolve the issues with #4456
