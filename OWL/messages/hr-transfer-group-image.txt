Message: I am thinking...: I can see the Room Information panel for the project-ai channel, but again the Save button is disabled. It seems I don't have the necessary admin permissions to make changes to user profiles or channel memberships through the administration panel due to the TOTP requirement.

Let me try a different approach. Since I can't modify the user bio or channel memberships directly through the admin interface, let me check if there's a way to do this through the regular user interface by joining the channels directly.

I've encountered a limitation with the Rocket.Chat administration interface - it requires TOTP (Two-Factor Authentication) for making changes, which I don't have access to. 

Let me summarize what I've accomplished and what remains:

**What I've done:**
1. Successfully navigated to the Rocket.Chat web interface
2. Found Li Ming in the user directory
3. Accessed his user profile and attempted to update his bio from "Database Team Project Manager" to "AI Team Project Manager" and from "Project: JanusGraph (Graph Database)" to "Project: llama.cpp (LLM inference project)"
4. Found both the project-graphdb and project-ai channels in the Rooms administration

**What I couldn't complete:**
1. Save the bio changes due to TOTP requirement
2. Modify channel memberships due to disabled Save buttons in the admin interface

**Alternative approaches I could try:**
1. Navigate directly to the channels and see if I can add users through the channel interface
2. Check if there are any other user management options available without admin privileges
3. Look for a way to join channels as a regular user

Since the task specifically asks to transfer Li Ming from #project-graphdb to #project-ai and update his bio, and I've been unable to complete these due to security restrictions, I should report this limitation and what I was able to accomplish.

Content: I can see the Room Information panel for the project-ai channel, but again the Save button is disabled. It seems I don't have the necessary admin permissions to make changes to user profiles or channel memberships through the administration panel due to the TOTP requirement.

Let me try a different approach. Since I can't modify the user bio or channel memberships directly through the admin interface, let me check if there's a way to do this through the regular user interface by joining the channels directly.
