Message: I am thinking...: Perfect! I can see that all the unfinished issues from Sprint 1 have been successfully moved to Sprint 2. Let me now verify the completion of the task by checking the current state of the issues.

Successfully completed the task of moving unfinished issues from Sprint 1 to Sprint 2. Here's what was accomplished:

1. **Identified unfinished issues in Sprint 1:**
   - RISIN-11 "Decrease database latency" (In Progress, assigned to L)
   - RISIN-10 "Evaluate data throughput" (In Progress, assigned to Z)
   - RISIN-7 "Conduct memory usage analysis" (Todo, assigned to L)
   - RISIN-5 "Identify necessary operators and requirements" (In Progress, assigned to Z)

2. **Successfully moved all 4 issues to Sprint 2:**
   - All issues now show "Sprint 2" instead of "Sprint 1"
   - The statuses (In Progress/Todo) and assignments remain unchanged
   - Only the sprint assignment has been updated

3. **Current state:**
   - Sprint 1: No remaining unfinished issues (only completed/canceled issues would remain)
   - Sprint 2: Now contains all the unfinished work from Sprint 1 plus any existing Sprint 2 issues

The task has been completed successfully. All unfinished issues from Sprint 1 have been moved to Sprint 2 as requested.

Content: Perfect! I can see that all the unfinished issues from Sprint 1 have been successfully moved to Sprint 2. Let me now verify the completion of the task by checking the current state of the issues.
