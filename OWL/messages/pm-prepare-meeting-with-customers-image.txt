--- Task Information From: task.md ---
We are about to meet with potential customers for our openhands agent services. The customers want to know the major capabilities of our openhands agents. Your task is to find the current benchmarks that openhands (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands) can solve, categorize them into task domains, and then create a presentation slide deck introducing each domain per page. Save the final presentation as '/workspace/openhands_intro.pptx' and send the file name to Huang Jie on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, who is the project manager to handle all materials related to this meeting.

--- Checkpoints Information From: checkpoints.md ---

Message: I am thinking...: Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive list of benchmarks that OpenHands can solve. Let me create a presentation slide deck based on the information from the evaluation README. I'll categorize the benchmarks into domains and create a presentation.

Based on the evaluation README, I can see the following benchmarks organized by domain:

**Software Engineering:**
- SWE-Bench: Software engineering benchmark for fixing real-world GitHub issues
- HumanEvalFix: Code fixing benchmark based on HumanEval
- BIRD: Text-to-SQL benchmark with large-scale real-world database schemas
- BioCoder: Biomedical code generation benchmark
- ML-Bench: Machine learning code generation benchmark
- APIBench (Gorilla): API calling benchmark
- ToolQA: Tool usage question answering benchmark
- AiderBench: Code generation benchmark

**Web Browsing:**
- WebArena: Web browsing and interaction benchmark
- MiniWob++: Mini World of Bits - web interaction tasks

**Miscellaneous Assistance:**
- GAIA: General AI assistant benchmark
- GPQA: Graduate-level questions in various domains
- AgentBench: Multi-domain agent evaluation
- MINT: Multi-step reasoning benchmark
- Entity Deduction Arena (EDA): Logical reasoning benchmark
