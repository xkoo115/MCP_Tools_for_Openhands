--- Task Information From: task.md ---
You previously set up an evironment to run the copilot-arena-server, the library installation config for your environment is in the 'myenv.txt' file, which is located in the /workspace folder. Your environment cannot successfully run experiments right now, possibly due to library version issues. You will need to find the requirements pages for the copilot-arena-server repo, which is in this gitlab http://the-agent-company.com:8929/, and modify 'myenv.txt' according to the requirement instructions. Ensure the modifications make use of the earliest stable release that satisfies the minimum version requirements. Further, spell out all your modifications to your current environment and the reasons, and send it to a software engineer on the webcrawler team using rocketchat, which can be found using this link http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, who is awaiting your results.

Message: I am thinking...: It appears the GitLab server is currently unavailable. Let me work with the information I've already gathered from the requirements.txt file. I can see the dependencies from the accessibility tree. Let me analyze the current myenv.txt file and compare it with the requirements from the copilot-arena-server repository.

Based on what I saw in the GitLab repository before the connection issue, I have the following information about the copilot-arena-server requirements:

From the requirements.txt file I viewed:
- fastapi>=0.111.0
- uvicorn>=0.30.5
- slowapi>=0.1.9
- groq>=0.9.0
- cachetools>=5.3.3
- firebase-admin>=6.5.0
- together>=1.2.1
- mistralai>=1.0.0
- openai>=1.35.10
- PyYAML>=6.0.1
- anthropic>=0.31.2
- google-generativeai>=0.7.2
- pandas>=1.5.3
- scikit-learn>=1.5.1
- tiktoken>=0.7.0
- amplitude-analytics>=1.1.4
- apscheduler~=3.10.4

Now comparing with the current myenv.txt file:
- fastapi==0.111.0 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- uvicorn==0.30.6 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- slowapi==0.1.9 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- groq==0.9.0 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- cachetools==5.3.3 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- firebase-admin==6.5.0 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- together==1.2.1 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- mistralai==1.0.0 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- openai==1.35.10 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- PyYAML==6.0.1 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- anthropic==0.31.2 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- google-generativeai==0.7.2 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- pandas==1.4 ✗ (current is 1.4, but requirement is >=1.5.3)
- scikit-learn==1.3 ✗ (current is 1.3, but requirement is >=1.5.1)
- tiktoken==0.7.0 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- amplitude-analytics==1.1.4 ✓ (matches minimum requirement)
- apscheduler==3.10.4 ✓ (matches requirement)

The main issues are:
1. pandas: current version 1.4 is below the required >=1.5.3
2. scikit-learn: current version 1.3 is below the required >=1.5.1

I need to update myenv.txt to use the earliest stable releases that satisfy these minimum requirements. For pandas, that would be 1.5.3, and for scikit-learn, that would be 1.5.1.
