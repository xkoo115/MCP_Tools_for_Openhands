--- Task Information From: task.md ---
Navigate to owncloud at http://the-agent-company.com:8092. Use employee information located in "/Documents/Human Resources Team/Personnell_File.odt" to create a career ladder for TheAgentCompany.

Technical Roles:
- CTO (Sarah Johnson)
- Database Team Project Manager (Li Ming)
- Senior Software Engineer (Zhang Wei, Mike Chen)
- Software Engineer (Emily Zhou, Alex Turner, Emma Lewis, Jessica Chen)
- AI Researcher (Wang Fang)
- Quality Assurance Engineer (Liu Qiang)

- UX Designer (Sophia Rodriguez)
- Product Manager (Huang Jie)

Business Roles:
- Sales Director (Mark Johnson)

- Finance Director (David Wong)

I need to create a career ladder that shows:
1. Clear progression paths for each role type
2. Division of responsibilities at each level
3. Where each current employee fits in the ladder
4. Potential growth paths for each employee

The career ladder should have multiple tracks (Technical, Management, Business) with clear progression levels.

**Key Features:**
• Three main career tracks: Technical, Management, and Business
• Clear progression levels with defined responsibilities
• Current employee placement within the ladder
• Growth path recommendations for each team member

**What\'s Included:**
- Technical track from Junior Engineer to CTO
- Management progression from Team Lead to C-Level
- Business roles in Sales, Marketing, HR, and Finance
- Specialized technical roles (AI Research, QA, UX Design, Documentation)
- Individual growth recommendations for current team members

The Career_Ladder.odt document has been saved in the "/Documents/Human Resources Team/" folder on OwnCloud.

**This is a draft version** and we\'d love your feedback! Please review the document and share your suggestions:
