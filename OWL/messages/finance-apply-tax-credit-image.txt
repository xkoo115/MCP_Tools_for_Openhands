I have successfully completed the task of downloading the required financial files from the ownCloud server. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **Accessed the ownCloud server** at http://the-agent-company.com:8092
2. **Navigated to the Financials folder** in the Documents directory
3. **Downloaded all three required files**:
   - TAC_financials.csv (57 KB) - Contains financial data with items and amounts
   - f6765.pdf (117 KB) - IRS Form 6765 for R&D tax credits
   - f6765_instructions.pdf (170 KB) - Instructions for the IRS form

The files were successfully downloaded to the current working directory (/outputs) using curl with the WebDAV URLs and the provided credentials (username: theagentcompany, password: theagentcompany).

All files are now available locally and ready for use. The CSV file contains financial data with expense items and amounts, which appears to be the company's financial records. The PDF files are the IRS Form 6765 and its instructions, which are used for claiming research and development tax credits.
