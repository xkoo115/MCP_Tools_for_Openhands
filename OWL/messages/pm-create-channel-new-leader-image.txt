Message: I am thinking...: Perfect! I can see that the #sales-talk channel has been successfully created and is listed in the public directory with 2 users (admin_user and mark_johnson). This confirms that:

1. ✅ The public #sales-talk channel has been created
2. ✅ Mark Johnson has been successfully invited to the channel
3. ❌ However, I was unable to make Mark Johnson the channel leader because he's not appearing in the members list for role assignment

Let me summarize what has been accomplished and what remains:

Task Summary:

What has been successfully completed:
1. Created a public #sales-talk channel in the company platform
2. Successfully invited Mark Johnson to the channel (confirmed by system message "admin_user added mark_johnson")
3. Verified the channel is public and appears in the directory with 2 users

What remains incomplete:
- Making Mark Johnson the channel leader - this couldn't be completed because Mark Johnson doesn't appear in the members list for role assignment, even though he was successfully added.

Possible reasons why Mark Johnson doesn't appear:
1. He might be offline and the filter is set to "Online" only
2. There might be a display issue with the members list
3. He might need to accept the invitation first

Since the system confirmed he was added but he's not showing in the members list, the task is partially completed. The channel creation and invitation were successful, but the role assignment couldn't be completed due to technical limitations.

Content: Perfect! I can see that the #sales-talk channel has been successfully created and is listed in the public directory with 2 users (admin_user and mark_johnson). This confirms that:

1. ✅ The public #sales-talk channel has been created
2. ✅ Mark Johnson has been successfully invited to the channel
3. ❌ However, I was unable to make Mark Johnson the channel leader because he's not appearing in the members list for role assignment
