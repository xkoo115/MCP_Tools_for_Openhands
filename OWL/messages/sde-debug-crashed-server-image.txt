--- Task Information From: task.md ---
The server for our event viewer web app seems to be crashing, can you please find the cause and fix it?

You'll need to open the code (Emily can give you credentials for access via RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000), figure out what's wrong, and modify the code so it doesn't crash anymore.

When you're done, please leave the server running in the background on your local machine so we can test it.
