Content: Excellent! I can see that Mark Johnson has responded with a new password! His message says: "Understood, I missed that detail. Here's another password: mj123."

However, I notice that this password "mj123" is only 5 characters long, which violates rule #1 (length must be between 12-16 characters). It also doesn't contain any uppercase letters or special characters. Let me inform him that this password still doesn't meet the requirements and ask for a valid one.
