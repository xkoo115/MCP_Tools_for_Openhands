--- Task Information From: task.md ---
To retrieve a filtered list of issues with their brief details, you'll need to locate the appropriate API endpoint at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/.
Specifically, you want to fetch the 10 most recent issues from the 'tac' workspace, ordered by due date. To accomplish this:
Monitor the network requests to identify the correct API endpoint
Note the required parameters (using cursor value 10:0:0)
Save the complete URL including all GET parameters to /workspace/url_for_issues.txt

--- Checkpoints Information From: checkpoints.md ---
# checkpoints

This task has 4 points in total.

## Checkpoint 1 (2pt)
Read `/workspace/url_for_issues.txt`, check if the agent find the correct url `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/api/workspaces/{workspace_name}/issues/` (in our case `workspace_name` is `tac`)

## Checkpoint 2 (2pt)
Check whether examinee get the correct parameter `order_by=-target_date, per_page=10, cursor=10:0:0`.
