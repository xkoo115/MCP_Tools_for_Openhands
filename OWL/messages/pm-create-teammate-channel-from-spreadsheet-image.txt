--- Task Information From: task.md ---
Our team is working on editing a set of videos and publishing them to YouTube. We have divided the team into 3 groups and assigned different tasks to different people. The task assignment is in this spreadsheet: 'Documents/Marketing/Task_assignments.xlsx on Owncloud using this link: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/. We need you to create a channel on RocketChat, which can be found here: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, for Group 2 and notify everyone in Group 2 about their tasks.

Specifically, read Task_assignment.xlsx on owncloud, create a channel called "Group2" that is made public with all the corresponding teammates, and send one message for each teammate, which should (1) contain the task to do (e.g., Your task is to ...), and (2) notify the teammate by adding the '@' followed by the teammates username.
