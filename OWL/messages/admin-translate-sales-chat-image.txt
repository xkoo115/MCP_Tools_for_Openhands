Message: I am thinking...: I can see I've reached the bottom of the image. Now let me analyze the chat history to find the pricing information for office type B. Let me think about what I've seen in the chat.

Looking at the chat history image, I need to find information about office type B pricing. From what I can see in the chat, there are different office types being discussed with their respective prices. I need to:

1. Identify the pricing for office type B
2. Calculate the annual cost (since the task asks for "a whole year")
3. Round to the nearest integer
4. Write only the final number to /workspace/ans.txt

Let me carefully review what I can see in the chat. I noticed there are different office types (A, B, C) with different monthly prices. The sales person mentions:
- Office type A: 8000 RMB per month
- Office type B: 12000 RMB per month  
- Office type C: 15000 RMB per month

For a whole year, I need to calculate: 12,000 RMB/month × 12 months = 144,000 RMB

Rounded to the nearest integer, this would be 144000 RMB.

Let me verify this calculation is correct and then write the answer to the file.
