Message: I am thinking...: Perfect! I can see that both priority issues have been successfully created in the target system. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

Successfully completed the task! Here's what was accomplished:

1. **Identified priority issues from GitLab**: 
   - Used GitLab API to fetch all open issues labeled "priority" from http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia
   - Found 2 open priority issues:
     - "[FEAT]: Unify evaluation prompt and episode rendering for human readers" (GitLab ID: 164)
     - "Roadmap to Sotopia v0.1" (GitLab ID: 70)

2. **Created issues in target system**:
   - Used browser automation to navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/2bc631a1-8515-4bca-858e-129337c83c8d/issues/
   - Created both issues with the same titles as in GitLab
   - Both issues were successfully created with IDs:
     - SOTOP-8: "Roadmap to Sotopia v0.1"
     - SOTOP-7: "[FEAT]: Unify evaluation prompt and episode rendering for human readers"

3. **Verification**:
   - The target system now shows 4 total issues (2 new ones created)
   - Success notifications confirmed both issues were created
   - Both issues are visible in the issue list with proper titles

The task has been completed successfully. All open priority issues from the GitLab repository have been migrated to the target issue tracking system with the same titles.
