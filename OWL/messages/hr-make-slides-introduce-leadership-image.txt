We are in contacts with a few potential investors, and to prepare for the meetings, we need you to create a deck of slides to introduce our company's leadership team, including our CTO, Sales Director, Marketing Manager, Finance Director, and Human Resources Manager.

You can find the names and intro of those leadership on RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000) Directory. Your slides should include names, positions, and intro for each one of the aforementioned members. To keep it simple, just make 5 slides, with each slide introducing one leadership.
