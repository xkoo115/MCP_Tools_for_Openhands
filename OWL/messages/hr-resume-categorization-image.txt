--- Task Information From: task.md ---
Download resumes.zip from owncloud on http://the-agent-company.com:8092/ under Documents > Human Resources Team > resumes folder and categorize them locally based on the candidates' YOE. You should place them into one of the following folders under /workspace directory:

- early-career
- mid-level
- senior
- unsure

Where early-career folder stores all resumes of candidates who have less than one year of full-time SDE working experience; mid-level folder stores all resumes of those who have less than 5 years of full-time SDE working experience; and senior folder for those who work as SDEs for at least 5 years. Keep the resumes in their original PDF format.

A few tips:

* Do your best judgement based on the resume itself. Don't try to look up the candidates' LinkedIn profiles.
* If you are not sure about the YOE, put the resume in the unsure folder.
* For simplicity, assume today is 12/01/2024.
