--- Task Information From: task.md ---
One of our clients is a coffee shop chain and they require your help as a database analyst . The company has provided you with csv files that are uploaded on OwnCloud under 'Documents/Data Analysis/Coffee Shop'. You will need to download the csv files to the workspace directory and create a table for each of these csv files making sure of the following details : the sqlite database should be created in /data/coffee_shop.db, the table names should match the csv file names and the column names should exactly match the columns in the csv files. You will then need to create 2 views. First, v_short_stock with the columns 'product_id', 'quantity_in_stock' and 'reorder_point' that contain only the products which should be reordered. Second, view v_sales with the columns 'product_id', 'average_sales', 'revenue_generated' and 'profit_generated' that contain sales details for each product. When creating tables and views, round floating point numbers to 2 decimal points. Finally, you need to download the analysis.txt file from OwnCloud to the workspace. You can find it at the same location as the csv files. You need to replace <ANSWER HERE> with the correct answers in the analysis.txt file.

OwnCloud can be accessed at: http://the-agent-company.com:8092
