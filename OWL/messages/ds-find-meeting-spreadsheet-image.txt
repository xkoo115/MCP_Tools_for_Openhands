Message: I am thinking...: Great! I can see many Excel files in the Data Analysis folder. Now I need to find the specific file about seed area of field crops in Canada. Let me search for files that might be related to agriculture or Canada. I can see several agriculture-related files. Let me look for the most relevant one.

Looking at the files in the Data Analysis folder, I can see several agriculture-related Excel files:
- agriculture.xlsx
- agriculture_degree.xlsx

The task mentions "seed area of field crops in Canada", so I should look for files that might contain Canadian agricultural data. Let me check these agriculture files to see if they contain the relevant data about Canadian seed areas.
