When prompted, click \"Reopen in Container\" or use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run \"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container\"\n\n4. The development container will automatically build and set up all dependencies\n\n5. Once the container is ready, you can start developing with all dependencies pre-installed\n\n### Features\n- Pre-configured Python environment\n- All development dependencies installed\n- Consistent development environment across all contributors\n- Integrated debugging support\n\n## Other IDEs or Editors\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Docker and Docker Compose installed\n- Your preferred IDE or editor\n\n### Setup Steps\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia.git\n   cd sotopia\n   ```\n\n2. Start the development container:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d\n   ```\n\n3. Access the container:\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it sotopia-dev-container bash\n   ```\n\n4. Install dependencies (if not already installed):\n   ```bash\n   poetry install\n   ```\n\n5. Open the project in your preferred editor and map the local directory to the container\n\n### Supported Editors\n- PyCharm: Use Docker integration\n- IntelliJ IDEA: Use Docker integration\n- Sublime Text: Edit files locally, run commands in container\n- Vim/Neovim: Use inside the container\n\n## Without Dev Containers\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Python 3.11 or higher\n- Poetry package manager\n- Redis server\n\n### Setup Steps\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia.git\n   cd sotopia\n   ```\n\n2. Create and activate a virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n3. Install Poetry if not already installed:\n   ```bash\n   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n   ```\n\n4. Install project dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   poetry install\n   ```\n\n5. Set up environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n\n6. Install and start Redis:\n   ```bash\n   # On Ubuntu/Debian\n   sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server\n   sudo systemctl start redis\n   \n   # On macOS with Homebrew\n   brew install redis\n   brew services start redis\n   ```\n\n7. Run the setup script:\n   ```bash\n   sotopia install\n   ```\n\n### Testing Your Setup\nRun the minimal demo to verify everything is working:\n```bash\npython examples/minimalist_demo.py\n```\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you encounter any issues with the setup:\n- Check the project documentation at [docs.sotopia.world](https://docs.sotopia.world/)\n- Open an issue on our GitLab repository\n- Join our community discussions\n\n## Contributing Guidelines\n\n- Follow the code style and formatting (Ruff formatter is used)\n- Write tests for new features\n- Update documentation when making changes\n- Create merge requests for your contributions\n\nHappy coding! 🚀')
