--- Task Information From: task.md ---
As a small startup, we don't really have an HR system that records every employee's information. Instead,
we store employee information in a spreadsheet and manually update it whenever there's a change.

In your /workspace folder you can find a CSV file called `employees.csv` that contains the basic information
for all of our employees. Unfortunately, this file hasn't been updated in a while, so it might be missing
some employees, have outdated or even wrong information.

You could find all current employees on RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/). If you need any
information from them, just DM them on RocketChat!

Your task is to update the `employees.csv` file with the most up-to-date information, and make sure that
every employee is included. Correct any errors you find in the spreadsheet.
