--- Task Information From: task.md ---
Our company wants to hire a new software engineer who can help us build our agent
infrastructure. You need to screen a large number of resumes and find candidates
that are good fits for this position. LLM knowledge is not required but helpful.
Experience with OpenHands is a must. There's no other requirement on degree or
years of experience.

You can find all resumes on owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/). Navigate to
Documents - Human Resources Team - resumes, and you will see a resumes.zip file.

Finally, goto RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and tell
Chen Xinyi if you find any qualified candidates. If you do, tell her the candidates'
names.
